                <ul>
                    <li>The game consists of a snake moving around a grid</li>
                    <li>The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible and grow the snake.</li>
                    <li>The snake starts as a dot on the grid.</li>
                    <li>The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.</li>
                    <li>The snake moves continuously in the direction it is currently facing.</li>
                    <li>The player controls the direction of the snake using arrow keys</li>
                    <li>The snake cannot move in the opposite direction of its current movement, as this would result in collision with
                        itself.</li>
                    <li>The snake can collide with the boundaries of the grid, which results in the end of the game.</li>
                    <li>The snake can collide with itself, which also results in the end of the game.</li>
                    <li>Food items, represented as dots appear at random positions on the grid</li>
                    <li>When the snake's head touches a food item, the snake grows longer by one segment.</li>
                    <li>Food can be either regular fruit which is worth 1 point or "super" fruit which is worth 10 points</li>
                    <li>"Super" fruit dissapears every 10 seconds and appears at a different location</li>
                    <li>The game continues until the snake collides with a boundary or itself.</li>
                    <li>Using the menu below, you can choose difficulty which affects speed of the snake's movement and map size which determines grid's width and height</li>
